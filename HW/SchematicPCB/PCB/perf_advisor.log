DRC checks
----------------------
* OK.

Constraint region check
-------------------------------
* OK.

Dynamic shape check
-------------------------------
* Generated positive dynamic shape has no voids.
  Suggest replacing with a static shape.
  ISSUE: Voidless shapes (e.g. thick etch) should be static shapes to avoid
         processing overhead.
      shape/region location:  (410.00 3136.00)
      layer:                  ETCH/TOP

* Generated positive dynamic shape has no voids.
  Suggest replacing with a static shape.
  ISSUE: Voidless shapes (e.g. thick etch) should be static shapes to avoid
         processing overhead.
      shape/region location:  (2240.26 568.84)
      layer:                  ETCH/TOP

* Overlapped shapes found on same net by layer, and the overlap is
  more than 60%. Suggest they be merged.
  ISSUE: Requires more processing to resolve correct voiding. May
  be an error such as importing a sub-drawing twice.

    Nested shapes list below:
      shape/region location:  (42.00 246.01)

* Dynamic shape has a large number of edges (53).
  Suggest re-entering shape.

         static to dynamic. Large number of edges leads to quality
         of voiding and performance issues.
